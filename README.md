# â˜• Java Core Concepts 

Welcome to the `collections` repository 

This main branch serves as the central guide to help you navigate through different Java concepts implemented in other branches.

---

## Branch Overview

### ðŸ”¸ `collections`
This branch explores the Java Collection Framework in action. It includes hands-on examples with:

- **List** (ArrayList, LinkedList)
- **Set** (HashSet, TreeSet)
- **Map** (HashMap, LinkedHashMap, TreeMap)
- **Queue** (PriorityQueue, LinkedList)

It demonstrates real-world scenarios like filtering, sorting, grouping, and custom comparator use cases to deepen your understanding.

---

### ðŸ”¸ `java8-features`
This branch dives into the modern Java 8 features that changed the way we write Java code:

- **Functional Interfaces**: Interfaces with a single abstract method (e.g., `Predicate`, `Consumer`, `Supplier`, `Function`)
- **Lambda Expressions**: Writing concise code using anonymous functions
- **Streams API**: Processing collections in a functional, pipeline-oriented style (filtering, mapping, reducing, etc.)

If you're transitioning to Java 8 or coming from a traditional Java background, this is a must-see.

### ðŸ”¸ `generics`
Explore the power and flexibility of **Java Generics** in this branch. Learn how to write:

- Type-safe reusable code
- Generic classes and methods
- Bounded and wildcard types
- Use-cases for `? extends` and `? super`

Includes comparisons to raw types and behind-the-scenes bytecode insights.

---

### ðŸ”¸ `exception-handling`
This branch focuses on mastering exception handling in Java:

- Built-in vs. custom exceptions
- Try-catch-finally usage
- Propagation using `throw` and `throws`
- Checked vs unchecked exceptions
- Try-with-resources for cleaner I/O code

It features practical examples like transaction safety, file operations, and validation logic.

---

### ðŸ”¸ `annotations`
Understand Java annotations with clarity and examples. This branch covers:

- **Built-in Annotations**: `@Override`, `@Deprecated`, `@SuppressWarnings`
- **Custom Annotations**: Creating and processing user-defined annotations
- Use-cases in frameworks and metadata handling

You'll see practical examples showing how annotations can reduce boilerplate and increase code clarity.

---

### ðŸ”¸ `regex-patterns`
Master pattern matching using Java Regular Expressions:

- Basic patterns (digits, characters, word boundaries)
- Pattern matching using `Pattern` and `Matcher` classes
- Advanced use-cases like validation, extraction, and text parsing
